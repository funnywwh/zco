- **Memory usage** reduced by 50% (stack size: 8KB → 4KB)
- **Three-level pooling architecture** for efficient resource management

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

| Scenario | ZCO RPS | Benchmark |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| 1000/10 | 44,308 | +14.5% vs Go |
| 10000/100 | 44,944 | Competitive |
| 50000/500 | 43,646 | Competitive |
| 100000/1000 | 36,938 | Competitive |

## 🔧 Major Changes
